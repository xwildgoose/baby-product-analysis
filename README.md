# üöº Baby Product Analysis üöº

## Overview

I was tasked with enhancing customer satisfaction, improving loyalty, and driving higher sales through our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) strategy. By leveraging data and feedback, businesses and individuals can more effectively meet the needs of parents and caregivers.

Utilizing data from Amazon's best-selling baby products, we aimed to develop a Baby Product Recommendation System Dashboard in Tableau.

## Introduction
My team and I were assigned the topic of marketing, and we chose to specifically focus on Customer Relationship Management (CRM).

What exactly is Customer Relationship Management? It involves a business or organization managing its interactions with customers, often employing data analysis to sift through vast amounts of information.

Our primary objectives are to increase customer satisfaction, enhance customer loyalty, and boost sales.

By effectively utilizing data and feedback, businesses and individuals can offer better support to parents and caregivers.

To this end, we have developed a baby product recommendation system using a dataset from Amazon.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

> The chart presents a clear correlation between review counts and average ratings, revealing a noteworthy trend: products with higher ratings tend to have a greater number of reviews.

In our exploratory data analysis, we conducted a detailed review of product ratings and their corresponding review counts, as visualized in the scatter plot in Python.

This trend could suggest that customer satisfaction, as reflected in higher product ratings, may encourage more customers to submit reviews. The higher the satisfaction, the more likely customers are to engage with the product by leaving feedback. This engagement is a key factor in our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) strategy, as it emphasizes the importance of customer interaction and satisfaction in driving business success.

The analysis of the Amazon dataset, as depicted in the scatter plot, supports our goal of increasing customer satisfaction. By focusing on products that not only meet but exceed customer expectations, we can improve customer loyalty and, as a result, drive higher sales. Products that achieve high ratings and attract a higher review count are indicative of successful customer engagement. Incorporating these insights into our CRM approach, especially in the context of our Baby Product Recommendation System, allows us to better support parents and caregivers, tailoring recommendations to feature products that are most likely to satisfy and delight our customers.

> Social Media Hastag Trends

Our analysis of Instagram hashtag trends demonstrates how data-driven insights can refine marketing strategies and enhance customer experiences. We've identified key areas where data from social media can optimize campaigns and improve customer relations, with a particular focus on hashtag segmentation.

By analyzing popular hashtags, we can pinpoint what resonates with our target audience. ‚Äú#ParentingTips‚Äù emerged as the most prevalent tag, indicating a high demand for shared knowledge and advice among parents. This insight guides us to create content that supports and engages this community actively seeking guidance.

The importance of social media in marketing is undeniable. It fosters customer engagement, increases brand visibility, and improves service. Our findings underscore the role of targeted content in boosting customer satisfaction and loyalty, key components in driving sales and reinforcing our CRM strategy.

The strategic use of hashtag trends on social media platforms like Instagram can significantly impact customer relationship management and business growth, by tailoring content and interactions to meet the specific needs and interests of parents and caregivers.
