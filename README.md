# Baby Product Analysis üçº

## Overview

I was tasked with enhancing customer satisfaction, improving loyalty, and driving higher sales through our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) strategy. By leveraging data and feedback, businesses and individuals can more effectively meet the needs of parents and caregivers.

Utilizing data from Amazon's best-selling baby products, we aimed to develop a Baby Product Recommendation System Dashboard in Tableau.

## Introduction
My team and I were assigned the topic of marketing, and we chose to specifically focus on Customer Relationship Management (CRM).

What exactly is Customer Relationship Management? It involves a business or organization managing its interactions with customers, often employing data analysis to sift through vast amounts of information.

Our primary objectives are to increase customer satisfaction, enhance customer loyalty, and boost sales.

By effectively utilizing data and feedback, businesses and individuals can offer better support to parents and caregivers.

To this end, we have developed a baby product recommendation system using a dataset from Amazon.
